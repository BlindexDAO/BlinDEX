# Blindex

Blindex is the first **multi-currency stablecoin-based DeFi platform** that sees all currencies as equals.
Replacing all traditional financial systems calls for a completely stable, inclusive, and **100% decentralized** alternative. We don't play around with centralized collateral.

```

Please note that the private keys and seed phrase above are valid, but random and public, use them only for development purposes. Or even better, replace them with your own development keys.

## Compile

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm run node
```

And on a second window run:

```bash
npm start
```

## Running tests

```bash
npm run node
```

And on a second window run:

```bash
npm test
```

If you also want to see the gas usage of your tests, run:

```bash
npm run test:gas
```

## @blindex/interfaces npm package

We reuse code between our blockchain & frontend apps. For that reason we have the `@blindex/interfaces` npm package that can be used to import all of Blindex's ABIs & Typescript types.
Enjoy!

# Accounts

Blindex uses 3 accounts.

### Deployer account

The owner of every owned contract.

### Treasury account

The holder of BDX reserves.

### Bot account

The account responsible for updating oracles and refreshing other parts of the system e.g. collateral ratio.

# Audits

We take security very seriously. Therefore the Blindex protocol had and will been go through security Audits.
You can find the audits we did so far [in our docs](https://docs.blindex.io/smart-contracts/audits).

# Etherscan auto verify contracts

All you have to do is get your `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in the `.env` file and then run:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network <network> DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```
